  <p>I have been a Science Teacher for the last 21 years. I have learned about myself, others,<br/>
  and the world in the process. I have found that I love data and finding ways to help others better<br/>
  understand data in the process. I hope to be able to use my many years of leadership in a new career<br/>
  of data analysis.</p>
  <p>Through the Data Visualization Boot Camp, I have learned skills that will allow me to apply my talents<br/>
  of analyzing data into real world programs used in many fields. I now am confident that I will be able to<br/>
  walk into a new career and be successful in helping any employer better understand what their data is<br/>
  is telling them to help them make the best decisions for their business.</p>
